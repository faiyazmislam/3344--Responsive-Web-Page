                            In our first lab, our assignment is to create to this entire website and its first four webpages. We can only use HTML and CSS.
                            The webpages we have to build are a home page, labs page, a page for personal information, and a resume page. The home page has to have a header,
                            footer, and a navigation bar. The labs page needs to have a layout for us to link our labs throughout the semester. We also have to create a folder
                            for the images that we use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have used some HTML and CSS in the past, but this assignment is the most I've used both of them.
                            Some of the techniques I employed in this lab include using floats to style the home page, adding multiple links
                            throughout the project, adding several images to a couple pages, and creating a table in HTML and styling it with CSS
                            in the labs page. I've never styled a table with CSS before, so I watched this <a href="https://youtu.be/dK27jWKtJxs">video</a> to learn how.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I first started this assignment, I could not figure out how to format the layouts of the pages. I watched a few videos and still had trouble understading.
                            I thought the lab was tedious then, but Professor Pascucci realized that he didn't finish teaching us CSS layout and finished the lecutre.
                            His examples during class made the process much easier to understand and I managed to finsih the lab within a few hours after.

                            In this assignment, we had two tasks to complete. The first task was to create a single responsive web page
                            that was comprised of four separate virutal pages and a navigation bar. The first page was the
                             had the header and introductory text to the site's topic. The second page was composed of 
                            three different sections. Each section had a title, an image with a caption, and some text. The next page
                            had a form made of ten questions using various html controls. The final page of site was a gallery of six 
                            images. In desktop mode, there are two rows of three images. In mobile form, the images all stack on top. Second part
                            of the assignment required me to modify my original site and make all the pages responsive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This assignment made me search for lots of example code and watch multiple videos to understand many different 
                            elements of HTML and CSS. From this lab, I learned how to implement features to make a web page and its elements
                            responsive. I also learned how to create a form in html and how each type of control works and is created. I can now 
                            additionally make image galleries that can stack in smaller screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This lab was long. There was not only a lot of time I had to invest into learning the different techniques and coding
                            but also a lot of time spent actually coding it and playing with CSS to create the pages I wanted. The second part of 
                            but also a lot of time spent actually coding it and playing with CSS to create the pages I wanted. The second part of 
                            the assignment, the modification of the main site, took the longest because I had to basically redo all the pages 
                            so that I could make them better suited for responsiveness. Despite the tediousness, the separate single web page 
                            was fun to make and it was intersting to see that I could make forms within HTML and actually collect data with it.
